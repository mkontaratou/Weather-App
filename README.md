# Weather App using React JS
## Details
Application that shows daily and hourly forecast for different cities. User can search for the weather of his city of choice. Default cities include 
London, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto and Paris. I used tools such as Tailwind CSS using OpenWeatherMap API.

## Material
- [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) : Used the Built-in API request by city name
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) : Helped by writing less code more efficiently
- [IconScout](https://iconscout.com/unicons) : Used for icons
- [luxon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/luxon) : Used for fealing with dates and times in JS
- [react-toastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify?activeTab=dependencies) : Package used to display fetching data message
